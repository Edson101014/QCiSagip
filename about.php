          <p>
            The Quezon City Animal Care and Adoption Center is an organization under
            the Quezon City Veterinary Department was established on November 4,
            2021 to focus on providing supplemental services for our fur-babies. We are
            committed to ensure the welfare and safety not only of our pets but also we
            extend love to our stray animals that roam in the streets of Quezon City by
            helping them find a loving family who will love and take care of them. We
            made this online platform to easily get in touch to our dear fur parents and
            adopter, to help with their concern and inquiries also to improve their service
            experience.
